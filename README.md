# libgoecharger
A C++ library to access settings of a go-eCharger wallbox.

For now it provides methods to query settings from a go-eCharger wallbox. Methods to modify settings will follow very soon.

It relies on the very small footprint json parser written by James McLaughlin: https://github.com/udp/json-parser.
